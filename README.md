nanoc_just_high_charts_example
==============================

A very simple proof-of-concept which originally used my 
[just_high_charts](https://github.com/StevenClontz/just_high_charts) 
experiment with a [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws) site
(that is, without Rails)

Since [lazy_high_charts](/michelson/lazy_high_charts) merged in some
requirement tweaks I made to allow it to be used directly without Rails,
this example actually uses lazy_high_charts instead.
